simplest plan:

get data: genre -> clips

for each genre:
    have user wear the cap while doing some task requiring concentration
    play random clip from genre
    measure what proportion of time user is concentrated over some of time
    repeat for more clips from genre if desired

determine genre with max (avg) concentration proportion
choose random clips from genre for recommendation
